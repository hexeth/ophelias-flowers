A striking decorative dahlia with deep scarlet-red blooms set against dramatic dark bronze-black foliage. Bishop of Llandaff is as much about the foliage as the flowers — it provides incredible contrast in any garden bed. Compact and prolific, it produces blooms continuously from midsummer through first frost.
