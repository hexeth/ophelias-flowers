A magnificent dinnerplate dahlia with enormous smoky pink-purple blooms that command attention in any setting. The large, architectural flowers have an almost surreal quality with their dusky, complex coloring. Strong stems support the impressive blooms, making them suitable for both exhibition and cutting despite their size. This variety produces abundant tubers and is a reliable performer season after season. The unique coloring adds an air of mystery and sophistication to garden borders and arrangements.
