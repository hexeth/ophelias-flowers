A dramatic cactus dahlia with deep, velvety dark red petals that appear almost black in certain lights. The pointed, quilled petals create a striking spiky texture that adds dramatic impact to any arrangement or garden border. This compact variety is well-suited to smaller gardens and containers. The dark blooms provide stunning contrast against lighter colored flowers and silvery foliage. A favorite for adding depth and sophistication to both garden compositions and floral designs.
