An enchanting decorative dahlia featuring pinkish-purple petals kissed with golden highlights that create a luminous, magical effect. The medium-sized blooms are perfectly proportioned for both garden display and cutting. This tall grower reaches up to 5 feet and produces a steady succession of blooms throughout the season. The unique color combination makes it a standout in mixed borders and arrangements.
