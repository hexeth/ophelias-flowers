A classic dinnerplate dahlia with enormous creamy blush blooms that can reach up to 10 inches across. Café au Lait is a garden showstopper and a favorite for cut flower arrangements. Plant in full sun with rich, well-drained soil. Tubers ship in spring for immediate planting after the last frost date.
