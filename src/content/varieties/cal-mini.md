A local florist favorite — easier to work with than the giant Café au Lait and gorgeous with so many color schemes. Blooms range from pure cream to pale pink to pink with streaks of deep rose, each one unique. An excellent bloom and tuber producer with a compact informal decorative form that's perfect for cutting. Not a true Café au Lait — planted side by side, they differ vastly in size, growth habit, and tuber production.
