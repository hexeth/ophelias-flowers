A delightful ball dahlia with charming pink and cream tones reminiscent of its namesake dessert. The perfectly formed spherical blooms have a sweet, innocent quality that makes them irresistible in bouquets and arrangements. This compact grower is well-suited to smaller gardens and containers. A prolific bloomer that produces numerous stems throughout the season with excellent vase life.
