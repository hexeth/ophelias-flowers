A soft and elegant decorative dahlia with luscious cream tones that blend seamlessly with hints of yellow and white. The gentle coloring provides a neutral backdrop that works beautifully with any color scheme in the garden or arrangements. Medium-sized blooms are produced prolifically on sturdy stems. A versatile variety that is equally at home in formal or cottage garden settings, blooming reliably from summer through frost.
