A distinctive decorative dahlia with rich rusty orange-red blooms that evoke the colors of autumn leaves. The warm, earthy tones make this variety especially popular for late-season arrangements and fall-themed displays. The medium to large flowers are held on sturdy stems and have excellent keeping quality. This vigorous grower produces abundant blooms and tubers, making it a reliable performer in the garden. The unique color works beautifully with bronzes, golds, and deep purples.
