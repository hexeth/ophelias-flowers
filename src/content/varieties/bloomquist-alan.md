A stunning decorative dahlia with rich, velvety red blooms that command attention in any garden. The large 6-8 inch flowers are held on strong stems, making them excellent for cutting and exhibition. This vigorous grower produces abundant blooms from mid-summer through frost. The deep red color holds well in both full sun and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to the garden.
