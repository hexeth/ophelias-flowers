The most exquisite shade of dusty rose — what we affectionately call "ballet slipper pink." Long stems are topped with slightly nodding formal decorative flower heads that look incredible in arrangements. Harvest when blooms are three-quarters open for a vase life of around 5 days. Pinch when 12 inches tall for the best branching and stem length.
