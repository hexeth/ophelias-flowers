A luminous ball dahlia with perfect spherical form, adorned with glowing pumpkin-colored apricot-orange petals on straight dark stems. Hardy and extremely weather resistant, Jowey Linda is a productive bloomer and a great all-around variety. Blooming massively from midsummer until frost, it makes an excellent choice for garden display, showing, or cutting. Looks stunning among late summer flowering asters and tall grasses.
