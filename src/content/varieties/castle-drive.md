A delightful decorative dahlia with soft pink petals that blend into yellow and cream tones toward the center, creating a dreamy watercolor effect. The medium-sized blooms have a romantic, informal quality that works beautifully in cottage garden settings. This reliable bloomer produces strong stems ideal for cutting, with flowers that maintain their color and form throughout the season. A versatile variety that pairs well with both bold and pastel companions.
