          Ophelia's Flowers is a small, seasonal dahlia nursery. We grow and sell
          a curated selection of dahlia tubers each spring for local gardeners and
          flower enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every variety we offer has been trialed in our own garden. We select for
          vigor, bloom quality, and garden performance — not just catalog appeal.
        </p>

          Tubers are available for order in late winter and ship in spring, timed
          for planting after your last frost date.
