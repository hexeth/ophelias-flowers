        Ophelia's Flowers is a small, seasonal dahlia nursery. We grow and sell
        a curated selection of dahlia tubers each spring for local gardeners and
        flower enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every variety we offer has been trialed in our own garden. We select for
        vigor, bloom quality, and garden performance — not just catalog appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tubers are available for order in late winter and ship in spring, timed
        for planting after your last frost date.
