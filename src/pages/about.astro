            Ophelia's Flowers is a micro-scale dahlia nursery dedicated to the slow rhythm of the garden. We believe in growing flowers that feel like they belong where they bloom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every tuber we offer has been grown, trialed, and harvested by hand in our own soil. We prioritize vigor and resilience over trends, carefully selecting varieties that perform honestly and beautifully in real garden conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tubers are available for order in late winter and are available for pickup in spring, timed perfectly for planting after your last frost.
